Packages are required to refer libraries within a package.

In this example, we will refer to "fmt" library.

You can also create an alias for the "fmt" library as well using

import sys "fmt" 

Here sys is the alias and "fmt" is the actual library name

It's used to refer to the system methods.

`main()` is the default function and it's executed on running the program.

Once the program is run, by default the `"main()"` method is invoked

#How to run?

In the command line, navigate to the path and execute:

`go run helloworld.go`
